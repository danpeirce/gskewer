This is a temperary file. I intend to write up notes before I forget what I did

Xand Y values
x = 99.97
y = 99.55

1.00421898543 expand Y

100.42 % used in cura to scale y.

printed
AB is now 99.96
AC is now 142.15

Based calculation on first equation at https://www-formula.com/geometry/rhombus/angles

skew.py needs the tangent of the angle pi/2-alpha
(note pythong works in radians not degrees)

Used python IDLE as a calculator

>>> import math as m
>>> alpha = m.acos(142.15**2/2/99.96**2-1)
>>> m.tan(m.pi/2-alpha)
0.011140566393579231


The current python file is called skew.py not skewer.
Called the file as follows:

python skew.py --xytan 0.01114 --yztan 0.0 --zxtan 0.0 YACS.gcode

which created the file used to check calibration
YACS-skewed.gcode
